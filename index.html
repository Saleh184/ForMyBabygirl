        <h2>My Love Letter to You</h2>
        <p>Four years ago, you walked into my life, and since then, every moment has been touched by your warmth, your grace, and the quiet strength that defines you. I often find myself wondering how I became so fortunate—how someone as extraordinary as you could choose to love me. Truth be told, I have never quite felt deserving of a heart as pure and beautiful as yours, yet I thank the universe every day that you are mine.</p>
        
        <p>You are, without question, the most important person in my world. In your presence, everything feels lighter, brighter, and infinitely more meaningful. You have a way of turning even the simplest moments into something magical—whether it’s the way you laugh, the way your eyes shine when you’re happy, or the way you hold my hand as if to remind me that I am never alone.</p>
        
        <p>Loving you has been the greatest privilege of my life. You have taught me what it means to be patient, to be kind, and to love with a heart that expects nothing in return. And yet, you give so much—more than I could ever put into words.</p>
        
        <p>If I could, I would spend a lifetime trying to give you even a fraction of the joy you bring me. I want to cherish you, protect you, and remind you every single day that you are deeply, truly, and irrevocably loved.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for loving me. And most of all, thank you for being you.</p>
